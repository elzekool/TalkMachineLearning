* Distance metric (Euclidean, Cosine and Jaccard)
* Collaborative filtering (User based, Item based)
* Single Value Decomposition
* Linear regression
* Decission Tree classifier
* Naive Bayes classifier
* Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, Coefficient of determination, Precision and recall and Cross entropy)
* Validation, Overfitting, K-fold
* Neurons, 
* Gradient Descend, Genetic Algorithm
* Convolutional layers
* Recurrent Neural Network
